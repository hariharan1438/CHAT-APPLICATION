##This project is a Real-Time Chat Application developed as part of Task 2 of the CODTECH Internship Program. The main objective of this task was to build a functional live chat system using WebSocket technology, and this implementation uses Socket.IO along with Node.js and Express.js to achieve real-time, bi-directional communication between users. The frontend is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a simple interface where users can send and receive messages instantly. The backend handles WebSocket connections, broadcasts messages to all connected clients, and serves the static frontend files. This project showcases the core concept of real-time applications and demonstrates how frontend and backend components can be integrated effectively to create interactive web experiences.
